Insights:
30–34-year-old females represent the most valuable segment in terms of both conversions and cost efficiency.

CPC is highest for females, yet their conversion efficiency offsets the cost.

Male audiences incur higher conversion costs, suggesting possible targeting or creative optimization needs.

CTR trends suggest older female audiences (45–49) are more likely to engage with ads, though their conversion share is smaller.
